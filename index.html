    <p>Each door has a world behind it. Each world different from the other. Let me start with the first door I remember The world behind this white standard door was one I would become very familiar with. The world smelled of home cooked meals and silent mornings, it smelled of spiced constant comment and egg burritos. The world looked like blended families, with an underlying hit of jealous and deception. With a deep sense of love. This world sounded like deep conversation in the front room, and petty conversations in the kitchen. The world always tasted, like meals that spent the whole day to prepare. This world also tasted like words slipping off the tounge to save face, from an argument that was had earlier in the day. This world felt like gentles squeezes from my grandmother and wrinkled fingers from scrubbing dishes, becausee we don't use a dishwasher in this house.

      <h3>Wilson Ave</h3>
      <p>This world had two doors, the first a gate, that opened to a beautiful glass structure, the 2nd a green old, ricket door that. Behind this world was a staircase that looked like it transcended to heaven. This world sounded of argurments and abusive relationship. Screaming and crying. This world sounded like Tv's being played at night and Gutair Hero played on repeat. This world tasted of Ramen Noodles in a plastic bowl, this world tasted of fhome made fried chicken. This world smelled like symphony of floral aroumasfrom my mother perfume collection. This world felt like clothes hanging touching the tops of my head, this world felt pucca shells creasting my face as I float from room to room. /p>

      <h3>Cardinal Lane</h3>
      <p>This world was one of the last that I travelled to and one that I learned alot at, hurt feelings and transformative experiences. It looked like antique interior. It sounded like continous chatter. It tasted like brunch, and meals from mcdonalds. It smelled like the same arouma of smells from my mother perfume collection. It felt like my piano keys and brass strings that would play over sounds of toxic eroticism. </p>
